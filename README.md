  <br>Hypa Git<br>
</h1>

Hypa-Git is a <a href="http://zsh.org" target="_blank"><code>zsh</code></a> script to help us with the robotic task of create RC's and merge all branches at the sprint ending.

Briefly what `hypa-git` does is create a new RC branch from last tag and name it based on provided semantic version option.

> Note¬π: This is an alpha version, which means that you might find some bugs.
> Please open an issue if so üòÅ.

> Note¬≤: I'm not a zsh expert. Perhaps some code on this script can be done better or are wrong.
> I would be happy if you open an issue to talk about it ü§ù
